Spell names have been replaced with various Touhou inspired ones.

Below is a list of all the names that spells have been replaced with.
If for some reason you do not wish to use these new spell names, an alternate sys.yml is provided that does not contain them.
To change them, simply rename the current sys.yml to anything, then rename the NoSpells.yml to sys.yml.

Agni = Fire
Flame Wheel = Fira
Giga Flare = Firaga

Icicle = Blizzard
Hailstorm = Blizzara
Perfect Freeze = Blizzaga

Thunderbolt = Thunder
Discharge = Thundara
Stardust Surge = Thundaga

Life Piece = Cure
Extend = Cura
Phoenix = Curaga

Whirl = Magnet
Telekinesis = Magnera
Vortex Pull = Magnega

Graze = Reflect
Barrier = Reflera
Duplex Shield = Reflega

IMPORTANT NOTE: Since the spell names have custom colors attached to them, the usual signal in the text to indicate MP Charge will NOT take affect!
