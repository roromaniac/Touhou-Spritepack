# Touhou-Spritepack
A mod that replaces various item drop sprites in KH2, as well as various junk items being replaced with Fumo's.

- Red P Tiles = HP Orbs
- Yellow Tiles = Munny
- Green Stars = Drive Orbs
- Pink Cherry Tiles = MP Orbs
- Blue Point Tiles = None. Haven't implemented them yet

List of currently (randomizable) available/findable Fumo's:
- Reimu = Crystal Orb (id: 226)
- Alice = Seifer's Trophy (id: 227)
- Remilia = "The Struggle" Trophy (id: 400)
- Sanae = Namine's Sketches (id: 231)

The pairing described above is the vanilla pairing.
